# ðŸŒ€ MazeFinder9000 ðŸŒ€

Welcome to **MazeFinder9000**, the only maze-solving algorithm that might **actually be sentient**. Or not. Weâ€™re still figuring that part out.

Ever looked at a maze and thought:
> "Wow, this looks impossible. Someone should just... solve it for me."

Well, congratulations, sweet summer child, because this is that someone.

- Avoids walls? Sometimes. Depends on mood.

- Super extra spaghetti code energy.
- Supports rectangular mazes, square mazes, hex mazes, maybe even emotional mazes.
